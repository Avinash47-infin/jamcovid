							<p><b>Testing for COVID-19</b></p>
							<p>I understand that I may be subject to testing if I am assessed as high risk either as a result of coming from a country designated as high risk for COVID-19 transmission based on classification by the World Health Organisation or due to other risk factors such as exhibiting symptoms or exposure to persons who have tested positive.

I may however visit attractions certified by the Jamaica Tourist Board within the “COVID-19 Resilient Corridor” provided that I travel to and from the attractions on transportation licensed under the Tourist Board Act, adhere to the relevant protocols for attractions, and remain with the family or group with which I travelled to the attractions.</p>
							<p>I understand that I must obtain permission from the health authorities to leave the “COVID-19 Resilient Corridor” and, if such permission is granted, I will be required to be in quarantine for a period of 14 days from my date of arrival in Jamaica.</p>
							<p><b>Isolation</b></p>
